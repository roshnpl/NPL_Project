# NPI

This project uses the NPI architecture to perform three tasks:
- Multiplication
- Bucket Sort 
- Selection Sort

Dependencies:
Python 3
Keras
Tensorflow
scikit-learn
numpy

Npi.py contains the code for NPI core

Bharat Matai - Bucket sort

Performing Bucket Sort which will use bubble sort to sort the different buckets in and then collabrate all the buckets to form the results in the TestModel.py file the buckets are created and then sorted using the NPI MOdel using bubble sort, bubble sort code we try to establish from the paper but are facing errors in giving accurate results and with Keras Implementation.

Roshni - Multipication

multiplication.py file is used which will perform the multipication between two numbers in the range of 1 to 1000 and trying to establish it with the left pointer

Khyati - Selection sort

Performed Selection sort by training the NPI model on a dataset with arrays sorted from 0 to 1000.
